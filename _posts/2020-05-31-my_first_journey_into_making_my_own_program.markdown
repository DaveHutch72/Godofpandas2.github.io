So I made a program. No matter how simple it may be, the fact that this happened after I started this program not even a month ago is truly amazing to me (if you would like to look at it is here https://github.com/Godofpandas2/4x-Calculation-Tool). This is pretty run of the mill stuff. This takes a foreign exchange API, https://ratesapi.io/, and takes in an argument of currency type and date and gives data on what other currencies looked like in comparison to the one you had entered. 

This project, while simple, still pushed me in a lot of ways. I made my first usable regex after much trial and error. I also used binding.pry well beyond any other project that I had used before. At one point in time, within my command line, I had a pry in every other line just so I could look and tinker and get some lines as shortened as I possibly could for my current level.

This is where I tended to find one of my weaknesses. I have a tendency to try to make any method I have as few lines as possible. While this can look kind of nice and does give me a slight sense of pride, it also something that it doesn't always help the readability of my code and is also a time consuming obsession that can be spent on other parts of my project/code.

This over all was probably my best teaching tool that I've had so far, because I was very much humbled. I had to do so much searching through concepts that I thought I already knew. It also reinvigorated me. I created something from scratch using a languange I had never touched before being introduced to Flatiron. This got my head a blaze with ideas and concepts that I very much hope I get to try in the not so distant future. So tomorrow I will take one more step in to learning a few more things and then the same thing the next day and the next, till I build my coding toolbox and get to show the world what I have.
