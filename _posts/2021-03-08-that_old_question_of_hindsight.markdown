Flatiron every week always gives us an email regarding, "what advice would you give youself on day one."  I thought I would tackle this question as my last blog post while still a current student at flatiron and also as a bit of celebration towards the end of my journey (so far).

I have stated this before, but one hour after I signed all the paperwork to start flatiron school, my child's school was cancelled due to covid-19. So throughout the first few months I had to work on trying to balance my child's need for attention and guidance, try to maintain and grow a healthy relationship with my girlfriend, handle the needs of ailing parents all while trying to educate myself on this software engineering course at flatiron. Needless to say I had to take a leave of absence due not taking care of myself during these times. So I'm gonna start there.

**1. Focus on you**

I know I personally started down this path because I enjoy problem solving and challenging myself, but I really am doing this to provide a better life for my daughter (and any other future, over energetic munchkins). So nights were spent powering through with early morning "wake and reads" on the treadmill while everyone else is asleep. I didn't get hardly any sleep in those early days and when everyone was awake, I always had someone vying for my attention/needing me to do something. I'm shy about saying no, so I oblige in the beginning, but there is only so much time in the day. You need to stand up for you and what you need, because what you need is also going to benefit all of them in the long run as well.

**2. Ask questions, it doesn't have to be to people**

Sir Gerald Duckworth was one of my greatest allies towards the end of my journey. As you probably guessed, he is also a rubber ducky (in what is basically a boating outfit). Asking questions as to why something isn't working out load, even if it is to an inanamite object can do wonders for breaking down and figuring out problems. Also you have sooooo many people to talk to and discuss issues at flatiron that you can always find that extra set of eyes to let you know that you made something plural that should have been singular. *face palm*

**3. You are going to mess up/get stuck/*gulp* fail**

That's ok, pushing through mistakes is the biggest skill you can learn. Whether that is taking 15 minutes to meditate, toss out some pushups to get the blood flowing or scream into a pillow, Find. Your. (hopefully healthy) Thing. Do not, under any circumstances, put yourself down for not getting a concept. This is the biggest mistake I made. With all the stresses around me and people counting on me, I felt like a failure. I put myself in a very dark dark place that took way to long to come out of. You rock. Don't ever let yourself forget it. 

So those are my basic things that I wish I had in front of me every moment to help me succeeed. Now that this part of my journey is done it is time for the job push. I am so thankful for finding this program and the people who have helped me succeed. Good luck to all in their future endevors and may you find the things that love as I have.
