"Why do you want to become a software engineer?" I feel this question is aked everywhere in the intro to programming environment, but I haven't had the chance to spend much time thinking about it. There are many things that are apealing to me in regards to it; working in a constantly changing field and thus always haven't to constantly learn, something that challenges and pushes me each and every day, providing a better life for my kid and myself, and many many more things.

I've worn many hats in my 30 years on this earth (I can only say thirty for one more day...sigh). I've worked in social services, call centers, heck I even started my work force career at 8 years old working in my family's restaurant prepping sides for the day. All of those jobs you can show your standard skills, certifications and work history, but there is no taking someone that you are interviewing with to your previous/current job and truly showing them all you do and know. I feel that is one of the things I love about programming. You can truly show someone, "Hey, this is what I have made." and they can see it, look through it test it or they can give you a problem and see in detail how you fix/solve it and go in depth on how you move through it logically. This may not seem as big as some of the other things I've mentioned, but with the jobs I've had and the amount of times I've been turned down for promotions
or that job that pays just enough to make you not worry, as much, about those bills at the beginning of the month. There will always be some biases in the hiring process, but I feel this field has more of a "I'm gonna prove why I deserve this" feel to it.

This stuff is hard, stressful, and even non-sensical sometimes, but that is what life is all about. Currently I'm doing this blog post after finishing my last project for the week and while my 5 year old is writing a letter to a friend
she hasn't seen in a couple months due to this Covid-19 world we live in. We live in a non-sensical world, but with a little elbow grease and an occasional (virtual) helping hand, we will get through these times and program stronger, wiser and with a few more grey hairs.
