I would say when I started this program I was one of those people who would continualy do tutorials and basic things that usually started with "How to learn to program in 1 month" or something of the sort and I would learn the basics and find a new/easy tutorial to go through thinking I was making some semblence of progress. After these past few months, I can definitely say the difference in progress is no comparison.

My project that I just completed was an AJAX application that ran off of a javascript front end and a rails backend. I created a basic hobby storage and pricing device, because I must admit, this shelter in place has given a slight increase to my stock of 2 player board games. 

This project took me into another relm. Javascript. The past few months we have been adding all sorts information to the space between our ears, but the base remained the same. We were using Ruby (and a little html here and there). Now, like I said before, I've done all sorts of random tutorials and javascript was one of those in that wheel house so I felt I had a bit of an upper hand. Lets just say, I didn't. 

Everything seemed so different from what I knew/know and no matter how simple the concept, manipulating the DOM, it still gave me fits, but day after day I started to see relations to previous things we have done and yes it may not be the exact same, but there is always google or fellow coding comrads for the stuff you don't get right away. I was to busy looking at the things that were different, I didn't look at the things that were similar and build from there.

The funny thing I'm getting from this program is that the more I tend to struggle in the beginning, the more I tend to enjoy what I'm doing in the end. Which reminds me of a quote from the philosophical  essay "The Myth of Sysyphus" by Albert Camus that states, "The struggle itself is enough to fill a man's heart." Sysyphus was a man from greek mythology doomed to push a boulder up a hill just to watch it come down and he would have to do it all again for eternity. I believe there is beauty in this and all my struggles in life and I'm happy that someday I will get to struggle at programming for a living.
