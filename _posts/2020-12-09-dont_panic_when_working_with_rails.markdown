My third project at Flatiron was to create a Ruby on Rails application that has a has many through route, nested routes, use fields with errors, be DRY (like my humor), etc. Golf is my passion so I decided to create a Golf course application that can sort by type of course. This is a very basic framework that I can expand into what I really want, which is a USGA handicap calculator.

This task was daunting at first, but I remembered my lesson from my previous post. Plan. So I got to writing out how I wanted it to look. That at first didn't work out, so I switched some things around to increase the ability to expand it later on, but still get the basic framework I was looking to create.

Rails is very beautiful with all the functionality that it allows you to have. This can come with a few drawbacks for the nooby like myself though. The main one this time, errors. I spent close to 6 hours on just two of the errors I faced in this program. Both of them came down to spelling errors. I had a belongs to that was accidentally plural and the attribute that my omniauth accepted was different then what I was running through its respective method. 

This caused a state of constant panic, error after error. Thank goodness I'm bald or I would have definitely been so at the end of this. Then I looked over at my book shelf. It is riddled with coding books, philosophy books, and waaaaaaay to much science fiction. I see it then. One of my favorite series. "Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy," which is truly one of the funniest series of all time. If you have not read it, it includes a book of the same name that has large, bold words on the cover that say "Don't Panic." I'd let myself spiral for multiples days. I did not take care of myself mentally. 

So at this point I'm behind as all be out, but I have a giant sticky note on my Darth Vader "Funko Pop!" that says "Don't Panic." So I don't (as much). I let logic take over and take errors in stride, dissecting them layer by layer till I get to the solution. I start rolling through my whole check list like I know what I'm doing or something.

If you didn't get the moral of the story by know you didn't even read the title. Life is pretty crazy right now. I personally am having to balance my child's schooling, my schooling, make ends meet, and all the other hectic adult based stuff that comes with being a single parent. You just have to put your best foot forward, do what you can, breathe when you need and most importantly, Don't Panic.
