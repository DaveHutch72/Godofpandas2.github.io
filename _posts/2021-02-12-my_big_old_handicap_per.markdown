This is my final project. The big one. I decided to go with something I'm highly interested in as well as highly in need of a free version of this to myself. A golf handicap anylizer. This is React front end as well as a Rails api backend. Currently this app just takes a score from an inputed golf course and give you your adjusted score based on course slope and rating. I will be looking to add functionality for Users as well as a variety of other statistical tools.

What I struggled a bit with was the openness of what tools we could use for the project. React has so many amazing things that you can grab and use that have already been done. It reminds of me of that one scene in the Hurt Locker that the Jeremy Renner character is in the grocery store and is adapting to the variety in the cereal isle. There are a million tools just for navigational bars.

This journey has been crazy. One hour after being accepted into flatiron I got a call from my daughter's school saying that it had been cancelled for the year. Fast forward through health conditions for me and all my direct family, in and out of classes for my daughter, many covid scares, and a lot of other hurdles that are a little to personal to put here, I'm finally at the end. I would not have been able to do this without the support of all of those around me and especially my instructor. We had way more in common than I could have imagined and she always kept me on the path when I was struggling the most (no matter how many headaches I caused her). 

So my biggest reccomendation for someone else who decides to do this. Think about yourself. For if you can elevate yourself to a place where you are doing something you love as well as bringing up your standard of living, you can help bring up those around you that you care about. Focus on you. You deserve it.
