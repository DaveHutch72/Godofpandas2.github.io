My second project here at Flatiron was to create a Sinatra application that tracks users having many of something and for the users to ony be able to see their things and not be able to see the other things for other users using basic security. I'm always in a constant battle with my waistline, so I decided to choose workouts for my "thing". 

This is the first project I have made from scratch that actually uses the browser to display the functionality. Going into this I felt very confident in my ability to get this project done based on everything we learned and my grasp on all of the lessons that we have had so far. Boy was I mistaken.

I made the (very fatal) decision in the start to just "wing it" and start by creating my users and building the user activity and just kind of "go from there" afterwards. This went well at first and I felt pretty decent after a few hickups. Then I hit it. That wall of "where do I go from here." 

A little pause in the action to give you some back story about my life and why the previous paragraph I'm most definitely going to get some shame from one of my best friends. See, this friend is a programmer and has been doing since he was 15. He was the one who actually pushed me to do this program. His BIGGEST lesson that he ever had for me when I started learning was to ALWAYS make multiple drafts of your code starting from the basic english of how you want it to work, converting that to pseudo code and then writing out the basic structure in the language you are programming in. I did not do this and I am sorry for shaming you Derek.

So, I started back up, created a paper pencil structure, simplified a few things and went to work. After what was about the same time it took me to finally give up from "winging it," I was done. I got all the functionality I wanted and it felt almost...dare I say it...easy.

Now, with my second project complete and a bit of unexpected extra learning under my belt, I now face the big one, Rails, with a restoked invigoration and understanding that through our failure and mistakes we learn (or reinforce) some of our greatest lessons.
